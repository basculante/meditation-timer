## Meditation Timer

A simple meditation timer to help with your daily meditation sessions. This was my first project. By building this app, I was able to learn how to use React as well as practice coding in Javascript as well as using Bootstrap for styling.

You can set the time to your preference and then begin your meditation session. There is also a pause button if for some reason you need to take a break from meditating.
